The most important part of a scientific presentation is the science itself, but nice aesthetics can go a long way toward keeping your audience engaged and leaving a good impression.

While revising a presentation recently, I rediscovered some gorgeous _Daphnia_ SciArt by scientific illustrator and artist [Julia Ferguson](https://www.paintingbiology.com/) that my former PhD labmate [Dr. Jessica Hite](https://evolutionaryepidemiology.org/) commissioned for use in her presentations. (You can find both [Jessica](https://twitter.com/JessicaHiteBio) and [Julia](https://twitter.com/JuliaFpaintsbio) on Twitter, and Julia is currently open for commissions, so feel free to contact her!)

Julia drew two _Daphnia dentifera_ hosts. One is uninfected, looks very clear and transparent, and is carrying several eggs in its brood pouch.

The other is infected, filled with _Metschnikowia bicupidata_ fungal spores that give it a darker appearance, and its brood pouch is empty.

Julia also drew a beautiful watercolor background to use as a background on the slides, which you can see an example of below.

As part of changing over my slides to the new aesthetic, I played around in GIMP to color the spores inside of Julia's infected _Daphnia_ (to show different spore qualities based on the environmental conditions when they were made) and it actually turned out really well!

Julia releases her art under a creative commons selected license - you can use it for non-commercial purposes, but you need to provide proper attribution (her name, and contact information if space allows), and you must ask permission if you wish to adapt or modify it.

If you have any other _Daphnia_ SciArt that you love, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter: @MartaShocket or via email.
