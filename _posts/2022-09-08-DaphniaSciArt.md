I'm a huge fan of #SciArt as a way for scientists to express their creativity and engage with a general audience.

During my PhD studying _Daphnia_ zookplanton hosts and a fungal pathogen, we would often talk about the idea of glassworm midge (_Chaoborus_) larvae as "predator spreaders" in our host-parasite system. _Chaoborus_ are really messy eaters, so as they kill and consume their _Daphnia_ prey, they spread fungal spores in the water column, **increasing** disease transmission. 

This "predator spreader" process is the opposite of how predation is usually considered to impact disease via the "healthy heards" hypothesis, where predators preferentially kill and consume sick hosts and therefore **decrease** disease transmission. The classic example given for this is usually wolves and deer in North America, or sometimes lions and zebras on the African savannah. (My PhD advisor Spencer Hall liked to point out that this healthy heards idea has even made it to the mainstream to as a factoid on endangered species chocolate bars.)

So when I found out that an artist friend of mine (the amazing [Eric Dagley](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly)) was looking for commission work, I spent some time thinking what to ask for, and I eventually decided that the predator spreader concept - while completely unrelated to my personal research - was probably the most visually compelling thing that our lab worked on. 

Thus, the [masterpiece below](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly/art/Glassworm-v-s-Daphnia-527518099) was born.
