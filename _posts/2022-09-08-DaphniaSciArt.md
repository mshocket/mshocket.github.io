I'm a huge fan of #SciArt as a way for scientists to express their creativity and engage with a general audience.

During my PhD studying _Daphnia_ zookplanton hosts and a fungal pathogen, we would often talk about the idea of glassworm midge (_Chaoborus_) larvae as "predator spreaders" in our host-parasite system. _Chaoborus_ are really messy eaters, so as they kill and consume their _Daphnia_ prey, they spread fungal spores in the water column, **increasing** disease transmission. 

This predator-spreader process is the opposite of how predation is usually considered to impact disease. According to the "healthy heards" hypothesis, predators often preferentially kill and consume sick hosts and therefore **decrease** disease transmission. The classic example given for healthy-herds is usually wolves and deer in North America, or sometimes lions and zebras on the African savannah. (My advisor Spencer Hall liked to point out that this healthy-heards idea has even made it to the mainstream to as a factoid on endangered species chocolate bars.)

So when I found out that an artist friend of mine (the amazing [Eric Dagley](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly), now working professionally in the video game industry) was looking for commission work, I spent some time thinking what to ask for, and I eventually decided that the predator-spreader concept-while completely unrelated to my personal research-was probably the most visually compelling thing that our lab worked on. 

Thus, the [masterpiece below](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly/art/Glassworm-v-s-Daphnia-527518099) was born.

I love how it's delightfully stylized, but not too cartoon-y. h=He did a great job of threading that needle, and of capturing the cloud of spores escaping from the infected Daphnia.

I'm not a trained artist, but I do have one Daphnia-related piece of SciArt that I made myself that I can also share: this ink drawing of a _Daphnia_ that I made to put on my custom business cards.
