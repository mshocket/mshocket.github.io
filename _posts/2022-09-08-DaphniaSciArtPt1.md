I'm a huge fan of #SciArt as a way for scientists to express their creativity and engage in science communication with a general audience.

During my PhD studying _Daphnia_ zooplankton hosts and a fungal pathogen, we would often talk about the idea of glassworm midge (_Chaoborus_) larvae as **"predator spreaders"** in our host-parasite system. _Chaoborus_ are really messy eaters, so as they kill and consume their _Daphnia_ prey, they spread fungal spores in the water column, **increasing** disease transmission. 

This predator-spreader process is the opposite of how predation is usually considered to impact disease. According to the **"healthy herds"** hypothesis, predators often preferentially kill and consume sick hosts and therefore **decrease** disease transmission. The classic example given for healthy-herds is usually wolves and deer in North America, or sometimes lions and zebras on the African savannah. (My advisor [Spencer Hall](https://hall.lab.indiana.edu/) liked to point out that this healthy-herds idea has even made it to the mainstream to as a factoid on endangered species chocolate bars.)

So when I found out that an artist friend of mine (the amazing [Eric Dagley](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly), now working professionally in the video game industry) was looking for commission work, I quickly decided that the predator-spreader concept - while completely unrelated to my personal research - was probably the most visually compelling thing that our lab worked on. 

Thus, the [masterpiece below](https://www.deviantart.com/boyfugly/art/Glassworm-v-s-Daphnia-527518099) was born.

I love how it's delightfully stylized, but not too cartoon-y. He did a great job threading that needle, and capturing the cloud of spores escaping from the infected Daphnia.

I'm not a trained artist, but I do have one _Daphnia_-related piece of SciArt that I made myself that I can also share: this ink drawing of a _Daphnia_ that I made to put on my custom business cards.
