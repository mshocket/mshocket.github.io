  ## Research

My research investigates how temperature and other environmental factors shape transmission of infectious diseases, now focusing on mosquito-borne diseases. My work combines field data, laboratory experiments, and mathematical models. I connect phenomena across biological scales by characterizing the organism-level mechanisms that generate population infection dynamics and geographic distributions.

Temperature is one of the most fundamental forces shaping life on earth. However, predicting the impact of temperature—and future climate change—on transmission of infectious disease is challenging for several reasons: 1) the thermal responses of the host and parasite traits that drive transmission are typically nonlinear and often unimodal; 2) transmission itself is a nonlinear process incorporating multiple host and parasite traits that may have opposing thermal responses; 3) temperature varies at multiple spatiotemporal scales; and 4) temperature often covaries with other environmental drivers. Traditional statistical methods are often ill-equipped to grapple with these challenges. Consequently, it is difficult to causally link variation in temperature to observed temporal dynamics and geographic distributions of disease and predict how changes in temperature will affect transmission, especially when future conditions may exceed the currently observed range or de-couple associations between co-varying drivers.

## Daphnia-fungal pathogen
For my PhD, I used a Daphnia-fungus system to test the field-based hypothesis that warmer temperatures promoted larger epidemics, using lab experiments to measure the thermal responses of host and parasite traits and to parameterize a mathematical model for transmission. This analysis revealed that warmer temperatures increase the foraging rate of hosts (and thus contact with parasites, which they encounter while feeding) and increase the parasite’s ability to successfully infect hosts (Shocket et al. 2018 _Am Nat_). Further, the parasite’s ability to infect hosts depended primarily on the temperature at which it was produced, rather than on the temperature in which it encountered and infected new hosts (Shocket et al. 2018 _Ecology_). This ‘trans-host’ effect is a novel biological mechanism by which temperature can drive infection dynamics, and could be important in other systems. I also tested another hypothesis motivated by field observations: do extreme hot temperatures exclude epidemics during the summer? Hot temperatures did reduce transmission via the trans-host effect and other damage to parasites; however, these effects were not strong enough to explain the lack of summer epidemics (Shocket et al. 2019 _Func Ecol_).

## Mosquito-borne disease
As a postdoc, I investigated how thermal performance varies across mosquito and pathogen species and across the different traits that mechanistically drive transmission of mosquito-borne disease by assembling datasets of temperature-dependent traits and fitting thermal responses to parameterize transmission models. I found systematic differences between the responses of temperate and tropical species that led to differences in predicted transmission (Shocket et al. 2018 eLife; Shocket et al. 2020 _eLife_; Mordecai et al. 2019 _Eco Lett_). Nonetheless, transmission for all vector-pathogen pairs is optimized at intermediate temperatures in the relevant temperature range in nature, in contrast to prior studies that overestimate the optimum. The results from these models—generated solely from  laboratory data—predict seasonal and spatial variation in human cases, evidence that temperature casually drives transmission (Shocket et al. 2018 _eLife_; Shocket et al. 2020 _eLife_). Moreover, while most research focuses on the positive impacts of temperature, my analysis of West Nile virus encephalitis cases provides some of the strongest evidence to date that hot temperatures already constrain transmission across portions of the U.S., and transmission is likely to decrease with climate change in many areas (Shocket et al. 2020 _eLife_).
