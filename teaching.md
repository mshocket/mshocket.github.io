  ## Teaching
---

My teaching philosophy is based on the idea that learning is an active process. Everything I do in the classroom is designed to create an environment where students are given opportunities to explore concepts and practice skills and feel comfortable making mistakes.

I am currently an adjunct faculty member for the [Citizen Science program](https://citizenscience.bard.edu/) at Bard College, an innovative January intercession course on science literacy that is is required for all first-year students. This upcoming year (2023) will be my fourth year teaching and my second year developing curricula for the program. Working for Bard CitSci has helped me hone my active-learning methods and allowed me to explore new areas of scholarship like environmental justice.

My formal pedagogy training includes a Postdoctoral Teaching Certificate from Stanford University and a graduate-level course from the Indiana University Biology Department.

My other teaching experience includes: two semesters co-teaching a class on vector-borne disease at Stanford University, two summers co-teaching a workshop on advanced statistical methods with the VectorBite Research Coordination Network, and three semesters as the lead instructor for my section of Introductory Biology Lab (a writing-intensive course) at Indiana University.

I have the expertise to teach a wide variety of classes across ecology and evolutionary biology at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including:
- general ecology or evolutionary biology
- community ecology
- disease ecology
- aquatic ecology
- biology of climate change / global change
- environmental justice
- biostatistics
- data science / scientific programming
